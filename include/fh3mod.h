/*
 * fh3mod.h -- FH3 Mod Platform API (MIT licensed, see LICENSE).
 *
 * The FH3 Mod Platform is the d3dcompiler_47.dll (and, the same file, the
 * DWrite.dll) next to azimuth.exe. It loads every DLL in the fh3-mods folder
 * and offers them the services in FH3ModApi below, so mods don't each
 * reinvent them and don't step on each other's files.
 *
 * A mod is a 64-bit Windows DLL in fh3-mods that exports:
 *
 *     FH3MOD_EXPORT int fh3mod_init(const FH3ModApi* api);
 *
 * The platform calls it once, on its own thread (never under the Windows
 * loader lock), right after loading the DLL. Do your setup there, start
 * your own threads for anything slow, and return 0. The api pointer stays
 * valid for the life of the process.
 *
 * Strings passed in are copied; nothing you get back needs freeing. All
 * functions are thread-safe.
 *
 * Compatibility: api->api_version only ever grows, and new members are only
 * ever added at the end. Check api->size (or api_version) before using a
 * member newer than the version you built against.

       Change what game code does, through the platform, so every mod's
       changes to the same code fit together: several mods can hook one
       function, each calls on to the next through `original`, and they can
       be switched on and off in any order. Hooks on exactly the same function,
       call site or pointer share it; the platform refuses a hook whose bytes
       overlap any other hook's, or game code that Extra Options (or a mod
       patching the game by itself) already changed, and logs who hooked
       what. Crash reports list every hook in place.

       Hooks in game code have to wait for wait_for_code (below). Hooks
       elsewhere (Azimuth, a Windows DLL) can be made at any time.

       Each call makes a hook, switched off, and returns it (or NULL, with
       the reason in the log). `name` is for the log and crash reports, like
       "RadioStreamFmod::createSound"; it may be NULL. `detour` is your
       function, with the same signature and calling convention as the code
       it replaces. `*original` is set before the call returns: call it from
       your detour to run the code you replaced (and any other mod's detour
       behind yours). It's safe to call at any time; while your hook is off
       it goes straight to the game's own code.

       When several mods hook the same place, the most recently enabled
       detour runs first. */

       has to wait for wait_for_code, the bytes are checked against the exe on
       disk and against every other hook, and it's all in the log and in
       crash reports. Addresses are exact: use them on the game build you

       own controls, styles and textures, laid out however you like, inside
       the frame of the game's options pages (background, player bar, help
       bar). `content` replaces what's between the title and the help bar
       (the HUD options page's BasicOptions panel), and must name the
       element to focus first x:Name="FirstItem". `resources` (may be NULL)
       goes into the page's ResourceDictionary. `help` (may be NULL) replaces
       the help bar's DefaultHelpPanel; NULL leaves only Back. All three are
       UTF-8 XAML fragments, using the page's xmlns (local: is ForzaUI).
       Like rows, the XAML is copied, and the page is written from the last
       you set each time it opens. A page with XAML shows it on its tile;
       under MODS > Installed mods it shows its rows if it has any, and
       otherwise its row says which tile opens it. Returns 1, or 0 if you
       have no page called `page_key`, `content` has no FirstItem, or a
       fragment's tags don't balance (the page keeps the XAML it had).

       Bindings: slot n (0..15) is an int of the page's, "FH3Mod_Slot_<n>",
       which XAML can bind two-way (a list's SelectedIndex, say), and
       "FH3Mod_Slot_<n>_Is_<v>" is true while it's v, 0..9999 (for

       A line of your own on the title screen, under "PRESS (A) TO START" and

       free): four at most, from every mod together. The lines show while the

       game starts signing in. If the platform can't hook the title screen
       (the game's code isn't as expected), they don't show at all and the
